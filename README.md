# Judge system file creator
## Judge system is a code evaluating system that SoftUni uses and develops. There are thousands of problems where you can solve and submit your solution and it performs tests based on your code. This tool helps you create files easily using the link for the particular lesson. It creates all the files for the lesson automatically when the link is provided, so you can focus on the problems and not worry about creating the files. 
----------------------------
### I upload my solutions to the problems there as I learn new thing and solve problems. They're located in my other repo named [Softuni](https://github.com/e-nurtin/SoftUni)
