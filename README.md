# Judge system file creator
### Judge system is a code evaluating system that SoftUni uses and develops. There are thousands of problems where you can solve and submit your solution and it performs tests based on your code, giving you points from scale 0-100.
----------------------------
### This tool helps you create files easily using the link for the particular lesson. The script parses the required data using BeautifulSoup after getting the data with requests. It creates all the files for the lesson automatically when the link is provided, so you can focus on the problems and not worry about creating the files. 
----------------------------
### I upload some of my solutions to the problems there as I learn new things and solve problems. They're located in my other repos [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/e-nurtin/SoftUni) and [Python Advanced](https://github.com/e-nurtin/python_advanced)
